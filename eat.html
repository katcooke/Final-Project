      <p>Everyone already knows how to eat. But the daily temptations we face occasionally veer us off-track. We all start out determined to do well, then that chocolate donut or that yummy pizza calls our name and we cave. For me - finally making the decision was something I knew I was going to stick with. That's when most people succeed at their goals - when they decide to. Here are some really basic, easy to follow guidelines given to me by my favorite nutritionist. He set me on the right path and gave me the encouragement I needed.</p>

<p>*Note:  <strong>ALWAYS</strong> check with your doctor before starting any new nutritional program.</p>
