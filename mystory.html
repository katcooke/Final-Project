<p>I am a 55 year-old mother of three, who still feels 21 on the inside. Unfortunately, I couldn't say the same for the outside. So when my daughter, Nikki told me she was getting married in 2015, I FINALLY made the choice to start the journey of getting myself more healthy and lighter for the big day. I gave myself 15 months, and began seeing a great nutritionist and working with a part-time personal trainer. On the day of the wedding, I was 23 pounds lighter, and I was beaming with pride for my own accomplishments but mostly for seeing the joy in my beautiful daughter's face.  I learned some HUGE life lessons along the way - some from my nutritionist, some from family and friends - but mostly from my failures.</p>
<p>I've always loved this quote:</p>

<p><strong>"Our greatest glory comes not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."</strong></p>
