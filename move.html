      <p>For me, working out 5-6 times a week was how I got the weight off easier. But I was advised that even a minimum of 3x/week, which includes some kind of weight-training is acceptable to reach your goals. It just might take you longer to get there.
Exercise is not only good for the body, it is good for the soul. As someone once said, "you never regret working out."</p>
